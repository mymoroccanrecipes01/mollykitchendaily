            "text": "Chili Colorado Recipe Chili Colorado is a traditional Mexican recipe of pork or beef stewed low and slow in a rich red chili sauce, hence the name \"colorado\", which means \"colored red\", not from the state of Colorado.      Save Recipe  Course: Main Course Cuisine: American, Mexican Keyword: chili, one pot, slow cooker  Prep Time: 25minutes minutes Cook Time: 40minutes minutes Total Time: 1hour hour 5minutes minutes  Calories: 344kcal  Author: Mike Hultquist Servings: 8 Tap or hover to scale 4.96 from 103 votes Leave a Review   Ingredients FOR THE SAUCE 6 ancho chili peppers stemmed and seeded 6 guajillo peppers stemmed and seeded 2 pasilla peppers stemmed and seeded 3 chiles de arbol stemmed and seeded 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano 1 teaspoon cumin Salt and pepper to taste FOR THE CHILI 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion chopped 2 jalapeno peppers chopped (optional \u2013 I like the extra heat and flavor) 4-5 cloves garlic chopped 2.5 pounds beef chuck roast cut into bite-sized chunks \u00bc cup flour Salt and pepper to taste 2 cups beef stock chicken or vegetable stock are good, too FOR SERVING: Crumbly white cheese, fresh herbs, spicy chili flakes, squeeze of lime juice if desired \u2013 Rice and\/or warmed tortillas, if desired Instructions Make the sauce first by dry toasting the dried peppers in pan about a minute per side, until the skins blister a bit. Set them into a bowl and cover with hot water for 20 minutes, until they are very soft. Transfer the peppers to a blender with oregano, cumin, a bit of salt and pepper, and 1 cup of the soaking water. Blend until nice and smooth. Strain the sauce and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to medium high heat. Toss the cubed chuck roast in the flour with a bit of salt and pepper to coat them. Brown the beef on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium heat. Add the onion and peppers and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute, stirring a bit. Add the red chili sauce and stock and bring to a boil. Add the browned meat back to the pot. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors develop. Longer is better, 2 hours or more for melt-in-your-mouth tender beef. If you\u2019d like to thicken the chili, remove the cover and increase the heat. Cook until the moisture cooks out and your preferred thickness is achieved.",
