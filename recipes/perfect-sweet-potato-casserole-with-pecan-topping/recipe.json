        "4 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "1\/2 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "1\/4 cup unsalted butter, melted (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1\/2 teaspoon cinnamon",

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).",
        "Boil the sweet potatoes in a large pot until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash them in a bowl.",

    "tips": "When making this casserole, here are some tips to keep in mind: \n- Use fresh sweet potatoes for the best flavor. Look for firm ones without blemishes. \n- If you want a creamier texture, add more milk gradually until you reach your desired consistency. \n- Don't skip the pecan topping! It adds a wonderful crunch that contrasts beautifully with the creamy filling. \n- If you're short on time, you can microwave the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. Just peel, cube, and microwave until tender. \n- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven for the best texture.",

I use pure vanilla extract for the best taste. Cinnamon and nutmeg add warmth and depth.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Pecans not only add crunch but also a nutty flavor that complements the sweetness of the potatoes. I chop them roughly for texture. Butter and milk help create that creamy consistency.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're out of brown sugar, you can use coconut sugar for a similar taste. For a dairy-free version, swap the butter and milk with coconut oil and almond milk.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good quality baking dish is essential for even cooking. I recommend using a glass dish so you can see the beautiful layers as it bakes.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
