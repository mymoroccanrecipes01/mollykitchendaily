    "tips":  "When making this casserole, here are some tips to keep in mind: - Use fresh sweet potatoes for the best flavor. Look for firm ones without blemishes. - If you want a creamier texture, add more milk gradually until you reach your desired consistency. - Don\u0027t skip the pecan topping! It adds a wonderful crunch that contrasts beautifully with the creamy filling. - If you\u0027re short on time, you can microwave the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. Just peel, cube, and microwave until tender. - Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven for the best texture.",
