Use fresh pecans for the topping; toasting them lightly before adding enhances their flavor. Avoid overmixing the sweet potato mixture to keep it light and fluffy. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through, about 15-20 minutes.",
