Using fresh spices will enhance the dish significantly. <strong>Supporting ingredients<\/strong> such as brown sugar and butter add richness and depth. For those with dietary restrictions, you can substitute almond milk for regular milk and use coconut oil instead of butter for a dairy-free version. <strong>Equipment needed<\/strong> includes a large pot for boiling, a mixing bowl for combining ingredients, and a baking dish for the final bake.<\/p>"
