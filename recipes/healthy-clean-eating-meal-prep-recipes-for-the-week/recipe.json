        "2 cups quinoa, rinsed",
        "1 pound chicken breast, diced",
        "1 bell pepper, chopped",
        "1 zucchini, sliced",
        "1 cup broccoli florets",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",

        "1 teaspoon paprika",

    "instructions": [
        "Start by cooking the quinoa. In a saucepan, combine 2 cups of water and the quinoa. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes until fluffy.",
        "While the quinoa cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced chicken, seasoning it with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 7-10 minutes until golden and fully cooked.",
        "Next, toss in the chopped bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli. Stir-fry for another 5-7 minutes until the veggies are tender but still vibrant.",
        "Once everything is cooked, combine the quinoa with the chicken and veggies in the skillet. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the mixture and stir well to combine all the flavors.",
        "Divide the meal into four meal prep containers. Let cool before sealing and refrigerating. These will keep well for up to four days.",
        "When ready to eat, simply reheat in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes until warmed through."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your meal prep even smoother: \n\n1. **Batch Cooking:** Cook a larger quantity of quinoa or chicken to use in different meals throughout the week. This saves time and effort. \n2. **Storage Containers:** Invest in good quality meal prep containers. I love using glass ones because they keep food fresh and are microwave-safe. \n3. **Flavor Variations:** Don't hesitate to switch up the veggies based on what's in season or on sale. I often use asparagus or spinach! \n4. **Spice It Up:** If you like a kick, add some chili flakes or hot sauce when cooking the chicken. It adds a nice zing! \n5. **Freezing Tips:** If you want to prep for longer, these meals freeze well. Just make sure to let them cool completely before freezing to avoid ice crystals.",
