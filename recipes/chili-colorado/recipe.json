        "Make the sauce first by dry toasting the dried peppers in a pan for about a minute per side, until the skins blister a bit. Set them into a bowl and cover with hot water for 20 minutes, until they are very soft.",
        "Transfer the peppers to a blender with oregano, cumin, a bit of salt and pepper, and 1 cup of the soaking water. Blend until nice and smooth. Strain the sauce and set aside.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss the cubed chuck roast in the flour with a bit of salt and pepper to coat them. Brown the beef on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate and set aside.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and peppers and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.",
        "Add the red chili sauce and stock to the pot and bring to a boil. Add the browned meat back to the pot. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors develop. For melt-in-your-mouth tender beef, simmer for 2 hours or more.",
        "If you’d like to thicken the chili, remove the cover and increase the heat. Cook until the moisture cooks out and your preferred thickness is achieved."
