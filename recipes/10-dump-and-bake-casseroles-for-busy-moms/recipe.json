I started making these when my kids were little and I was running on like three hours of sleep. No fancy prep work, no standing over the stove. Just dump it all in and walk away.</p><p>The best part is these casseroles taste way better than the effort you put in. My family never complains about casserole night. Usually they ask when we're having it again. That's when you know you found a keeper recipe.</p>"

Basically whatever sounds good or needs to get used up.</li><li><strong>A casserole dish:</strong> Any size that fits your oven. I use a 9x13 most of the time because it feeds everyone.</li></ul>"
