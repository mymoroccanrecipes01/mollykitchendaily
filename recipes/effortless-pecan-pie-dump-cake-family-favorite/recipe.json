    "tips": "To elevate your pecan pie dump cake, consider these professional tips: \n- Use fresh, high-quality pecans for the best flavor. Toasting them enhances their nuttiness and adds a delightful crunch. \n- Ensure your butter is fully melted but not too hot when mixing with other ingredients to avoid cooking the eggs prematurely. \n- Avoid overmixing the batter; a few lumps are okay. This helps maintain a tender texture. \n- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes to restore its warm, gooey texture. \n- For a unique twist, add a splash of bourbon to the filling for a richer flavor profile.",

For a nut-free version, consider using chocolate chips or dried fruits instead of pecans.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A 9x13 inch baking dish is essential for this recipe, allowing for even baking.
