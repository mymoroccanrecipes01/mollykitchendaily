Avoid over-mixing the sweet potato mixture to keep it fluffy. If you want to make this ahead, prepare the casserole up to the baking step and refrigerate it. Bake it fresh before serving for a warm, comforting dish. To reheat leftovers, cover with foil and warm in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15-20 minutes.",

            "content": "<p>When making this casserole, the main ingredient is sweet potatoes. Look for firm, vibrant sweet potatoes without blemishes for the best flavor and texture. They should be rich in color, indicating ripeness. For the sweetener, brown sugar adds a deep, caramel-like flavor that enhances the sweetness of the potatoes. If you prefer a healthier option, consider using maple syrup instead. The pecans not only provide a crunchy topping but also add a nutty flavor that complements the dish beautifully. For those with dietary restrictions, you can substitute dairy milk with almond or oat milk for a dairy-free version. Essential tools include a large pot for boiling, a mixing bowl for combining ingredients, and a baking dish for cooking.<\/p>"
