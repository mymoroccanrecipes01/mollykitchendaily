Ensure they are at room temperature for easy mixing.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> For a dairy-free version, use vegan cream cheese and yogurt. For a lower-sugar option, consider using honey or agave syrup instead of sugar.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A medium saucepan for cooking, a mixing bowl for combining ingredients, and a serving dish for presentation.<\/li><\/ul>"
