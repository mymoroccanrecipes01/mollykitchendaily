    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: When making this casserole, I always recommend using fresh ingredients for the best flavor. If you want a bit of a kick, try adding some diced jalapeños or green chilies. You can also swap out the cheddar for pepper jack cheese for a spicier version. For a creamier texture, consider adding an extra dollop of sour cream. And if you have leftovers, they reheat beautifully in the oven or microwave. Just make sure to cover it to keep it moist!",
