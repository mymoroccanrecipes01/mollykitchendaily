    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: Here are some tips to make your macaroni and cheese even better: 1. Use high-quality cheese like Tillamook for a richer flavor. The better the cheese, the better the dish! 2. If you want to add some extra flavor, try mixing in cooked bacon or sautéed vegetables. My kids love it with broccoli! 3. Be careful not to overcook the pasta; it should be al dente since it will continue to cook in the cheese sauce. 4. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of milk to bring back the creaminess. 5. My secret? A pinch of cayenne pepper adds a nice kick without being too spicy. Trust me, it’s a game changer!",
