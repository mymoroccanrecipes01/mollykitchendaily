Avoid overcooking the beans; they should be tender but not mushy. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth if needed. For a spicier kick, add diced jalapeños or a dash of cayenne pepper.",
