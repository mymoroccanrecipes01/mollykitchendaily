    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: Here are some pro tips to make your Rice Krispie Treats even better! First, use fresh marshmallows for the best texture. If you want a richer flavor, try adding a pinch of salt to the melted marshmallow mixture. For a fun twist, mix in some chocolate chips or peanut butter for extra flavor. When pressing the mixture into the pan, dampen your hands slightly to avoid sticking. And if you have leftovers (which is rare!), store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to a month, just make sure to wrap them well!",
