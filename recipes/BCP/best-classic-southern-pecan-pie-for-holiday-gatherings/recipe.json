Avoid overbaking; the filling should be slightly jiggly when you take it out of the oven, as it will continue to set while cooling. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, and reheat gently in the oven to preserve the crust's texture. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of bourbon to the filling.",

            "content": "<p>When making pecan pie, the key ingredient is the pecans. Look for fresh, high-quality pecans, as they provide the signature flavor and texture. Chopped pecans work best for even distribution in the filling. The corn syrup is essential for achieving that gooey consistency, while granulated sugar adds sweetness. For a deeper flavor, consider using dark corn syrup. If you're looking for alternatives, you can use maple syrup or honey, but be aware that they will alter the taste slightly. A pre-made pie crust saves time, but making your own from scratch can elevate the dish. Essential tools include a mixing bowl, whisk, and a pie dish for baking.<\/p>"
