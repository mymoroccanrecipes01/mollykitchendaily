If you\u0027re a fan of spice, try adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mix for a kick! Also, don\u0027t skip the cooling step; it helps the flavors meld together beautifully. Leftovers? They keep well in the fridge for about 3 days, just reheat gently in the microwave. And if you want to switch things up, consider using sweet pickles for a different flavor profile.",
