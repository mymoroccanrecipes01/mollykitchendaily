    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: When making this dip, remember that the cream cheese needs to be soft for the best texture. I usually let it sit out for about 10 minutes before mixing. If you want to add a little kick, consider using a spicier pepper jelly. You can also experiment with different toppings like crushed nuts or fresh herbs. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. Just give it a quick stir before serving again. And trust me, this dip tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld together!",
