Use high-quality dried fruits for maximum flavor; look for those without added sugars. Avoid overmixing the ingredients to keep the texture light. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of brandy or rum to the mixture before pressing it into the tin.",
