Just stick them in the freezer for a bit. - Mix up the ice cream flavors - chocolate\u0027s pretty solid, and mint\u0027s actually really good if you\u0027re into that. - Go wild with toppings. There\u0027s no float police. - If somehow you don\u0027t finish them all (never happens at my house), keep the soda and ice cream separate or it gets weird. - Toss in some flavored syrup if you want to experiment. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u0027t.",
