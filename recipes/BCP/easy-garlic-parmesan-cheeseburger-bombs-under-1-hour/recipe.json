    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: To ensure perfect cheeseburger bombs, use high-quality ground beef and season it well for maximum flavor. Avoid overfilling the biscuits to prevent them from bursting during baking. For a crispy exterior, brush the tops with melted butter before baking. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, and reheat in the oven to maintain crispiness. If you\u0027re short on time, you can use pre-cooked beef or leftover burgers for a quicker option.",
