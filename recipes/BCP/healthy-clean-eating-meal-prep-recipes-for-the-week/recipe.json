                         "While the quinoa cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced chicken, seasoning it with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 7-10 minutes until golden and fully cooked.",
                         "Next, toss in the chopped bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli. Stir-fry for another 5-7 minutes until the veggies are tender but still vibrant.",

    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: Here are some tips to make your meal prep even smoother: 1. **Batch Cooking:** Cook a larger quantity of quinoa or chicken to use in different meals throughout the week. This saves time and effort. 2. **Storage Containers:** Invest in good quality meal prep containers. I love using glass ones because they keep food fresh and are microwave-safe. 3. **Flavor Variations:** Don\u0027t hesitate to switch up the veggies based on what\u0027s in season or on sale. I often use asparagus or spinach! 4. **Spice It Up:** If you like a kick, add some chili flakes or hot sauce when cooking the chicken. It adds a nice zing! 5. **Freezing Tips:** If you want to prep for longer, these meals freeze well. Just make sure to let them cool completely before freezing to avoid ice crystals.",
