                        "1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened",

    "instructions":  [
                         "Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cubed Yukon gold potatoes and cook until fork-tender, about 15 minutes.",
                         "While the potatoes are cooking, heat the heavy cream and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed through. Add the minced garlic and let it infuse for a few minutes.",
                         "Once the potatoes are done, drain them well and return them to the pot. Mash them using a potato masher or a ricer for a smoother texture.",
                         "Pour the warm cream and garlic mixture over the mashed potatoes. Stir until well combined and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
                         "Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving bowl and garnish with chopped chives or parsley if desired. Serve warm."
                     ],
    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: When making mashed potatoes, it’s key to use the right type of potato. Yukon golds are great because they’re naturally buttery and creamy. I recommend using a ricer for the fluffiest texture. Also, don’t skip on the seasoning—taste as you go! If you want to prep ahead, you can make the mashed potatoes a day in advance and reheat them gently on the stove, adding a splash of cream to restore creaminess. And remember, the garlic can be adjusted; if you love it, add more! Lastly, for a twist, try adding some grated cheese or sour cream for extra flavor.",
