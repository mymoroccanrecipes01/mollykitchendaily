I love using a mix of seasonal veggies for freshness. If you’re short on time, frozen veggies work great too! My secret? Always keep canned beans on hand for a protein boost. And don\u0027t forget to taste as you go - it makes a world of difference! For leftovers, store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat on the stove for best results, adding a splash of water to keep it moist.",
