    "tips":  "Okay so real talk - use tortillas that are actually fresh, not the ones that\u0027ve been sitting in your pantry for weeks. If they\u0027re kinda stiff, just pop them in the microwave for like 10 seconds. And honestly? Throw in whatever veggies you\u0027ve got. I\u0027ve used olives, different cheeses, even leftover roasted peppers. Want some heat? Jalapeños are your friend, or just mix some chili powder into the cream cheese. Make these the night before if you\u0027re hosting - less stress, more wine. Oh and if you need them gluten-free, corn tortillas work great, just saying.",
