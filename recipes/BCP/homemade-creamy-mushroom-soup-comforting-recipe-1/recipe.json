A common mistake is overcooking the garlic, which can lead to bitterness, so add it after the onions are translucent. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days; reheat gently on the stove. For consistent results, maintain a simmer rather than a boil when cooking the soup.",

Supporting ingredients such as heavy cream give the soup its signature creaminess, while vegetable broth provides a flavorful base.
