                         "Stir in the carrots and potatoes, cooking for another 5 minutes. Then, return the beef to the pot.",

    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: Here are some tips to make your beef stew even better: - **Browning the meat:** Make sure to brown the beef well; it adds depth to the flavor. I usually do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. - **Vegetable choices:** Feel free to add other veggies like peas or green beans for extra color and nutrition. Just toss them in during the last 10 minutes of cooking. - **Thickening the stew:** If you prefer a thicker stew, mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with cold water and stir it in during the last few minutes of cooking. - **Flavor boost:** I like to add a splash of red wine for richness. Just let it simmer a bit longer to cook off the alcohol. - **Storage:** This stew keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days. Just reheat gently on the stove. It also freezes nicely for up to 3 months, so it’s great for meal prep! - **Personal touch:** I always use organic beef broth for a richer taste. Trust me, it makes a difference!",
