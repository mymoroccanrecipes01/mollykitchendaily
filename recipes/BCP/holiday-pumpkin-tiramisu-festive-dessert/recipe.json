    "tips":  "To achieve the best results with this pumpkin tiramisu, consider these professional tips: - Use high-quality mascarpone cheese for a rich and creamy texture. Look for brands that are smooth and not overly grainy. - Ensure your espresso is cooled before dipping the ladyfingers; this prevents them from becoming too soggy. - Avoid over-whipping the heavy cream to maintain a light and airy texture in the final dessert. - For storage, keep the tiramisu covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can also be frozen for up to a month, but the texture may change slightly upon thawing. - Serve chilled for the best flavor experience, and consider adding a sprinkle of nutmeg for an extra flavor boost.",
