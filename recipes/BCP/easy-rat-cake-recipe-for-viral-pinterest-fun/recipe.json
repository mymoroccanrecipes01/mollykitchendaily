                         "Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth. Then, carefully stir in the boiling water (the batter will be thin).",
                         "Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks.",
                         "Once cooled, level the tops of the cakes if needed. Spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake, then place the second cake on top. Frost the entire cake and get creative with the decorations!",

    "tips":  "Here\u0027s the thing: Here are some tips to make your rat cake a success! First, make sure your ingredients are at room temperature for better mixing. If your cake layers dome up while baking, just slice off the tops to make them flat. For a richer flavor, you can substitute half of the boiling water with brewed coffee (trust me, it enhances the chocolate!). When frosting, use a spatula to create texture for a fur-like appearance. And if you\u0027re short on time, store-bought frosting works just fine! You can also prepare the cake layers a day in advance and store them wrapped in plastic wrap to keep them fresh. Lastly, don\u0027t stress about the decorations; the more playful, the better!",
