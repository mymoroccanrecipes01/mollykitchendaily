        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1\/2 cup all-purpose flour",
        "1\/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt",

        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper.",
        "In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and granulated sugar until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt until just combined.",
        "In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture until no white streaks remain.",
        "Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched.",

        "For the filling, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Unroll the cooled cake, spread the cream filling evenly, and re-roll the cake without the towel. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving."
