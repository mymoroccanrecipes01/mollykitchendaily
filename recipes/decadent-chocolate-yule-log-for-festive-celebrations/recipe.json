    "ingredients": [
        "4 large eggs, separated",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1\/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1\/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted",
        "1\/4 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream",

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 15x10 inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper.",
        "In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and granulated sugar until thick and pale. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, mixing until just combined.",
        "In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture until no streaks remain.",
        "Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched.",
        "Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Carefully roll the cake in the parchment paper, starting from the short end, and let it cool completely.",
        "For the filling, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Unroll the cooled cake, spread the whipped cream evenly, and roll it back up. Dust with cocoa powder and garnish with chocolate shavings before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your Yule log a success: \n- Use room temperature eggs for better volume when whipping. \n- Be gentle when folding in the egg whites; you want to keep that airy texture. \n- If the cake cracks while rolling, don't worry! Just cover it with frosting or powdered sugar. \n- For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of coffee to the batter. \n- Store leftovers in the fridge, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.",
