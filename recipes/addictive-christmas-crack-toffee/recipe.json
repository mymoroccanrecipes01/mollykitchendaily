Sounds weird but it's so good. I make it every year and people literally ask me for the recipe before they even finish eating it.</p><p>The whole thing takes maybe 30 minutes and most of that is just waiting for stuff to cool. Super easy but everyone thinks you did something fancy. Perfect for when you need to bring something to a party and want to look like you tried really hard.</p>"

This is what makes the toffee rich and good.</li><li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> Gives it that caramel taste. Don't substitute white sugar, it won't be the same. Dark or light brown both work fine.</li><li><strong>Saltine crackers:</strong> Sounds crazy but trust me. The salty crackers with the sweet toffee is what makes this work. Generic brand is totally fine.</li><li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Semi-sweet is classic but you can use milk chocolate or dark chocolate. Whatever you like. I always use semi-sweet because it's not too sweet.</li><li><strong>Nuts:</strong> Optional but they add good crunch. Pecans or almonds work great. I skip them sometimes when I'm lazy.</li></ul>"
