    "ingredients": [
        "1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade)",
        "1 cup light corn syrup",
        "1 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "4 large eggs",
        "1\/4 cup unsalted butter, melted (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "2 cups pecan halves",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll out the pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan, trimming any excess.",
        "In a large bowl, whisk together the corn syrup, brown sugar, and melted butter until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.",
        "Stir in the vanilla extract and salt. Fold in the pecan halves until they’re evenly coated.",
        "Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust, spreading the pecans evenly on top.",
        "Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. You’ll know it’s done when it jiggles slightly in the center.",
        "Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before slicing. Serve it warm or at room temperature, maybe with some whipped cream!"
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your pecan pie a hit: \n\n1. **Use fresh pecans:** I always buy my pecans from a local farmer’s market when possible. Fresh nuts have a better flavor and crunch. \n2. **Don’t skip the cooling time:** It’s tempting to dive right in, but letting the pie cool helps it set properly. Trust me, it’s worth the wait! \n3. **Check for doneness:** If the edges start to brown too quickly, cover them with foil to prevent burning. \n4. **Storage:** Keep leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days. Just reheat in the oven for a few minutes to enjoy again. \n5. **Experiment with flavors:** Sometimes, I add a splash of bourbon or a pinch of cinnamon for a twist. It adds a nice depth of flavor!",

Use a good quality brand for the best results. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The corn syrup and brown sugar create that gooey texture. I like to use light corn syrup for a milder flavor. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you’re out of corn syrup, you can use maple syrup or honey, but the flavor will change slightly. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good pie dish is essential.
