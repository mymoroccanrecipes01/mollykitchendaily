For a fun twist, try adding a splash of soda water for some fizz. Store any leftover cherry mixture in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

If fresh cherries are not available, you can use frozen cherries, but be sure to thaw them first. The cherry liqueur adds depth and sweetness, while the vodka serves as the base spirit. For those who prefer a lighter drink, consider using a flavored vodka or a lower-calorie sweetener instead of simple syrup. Essential tools include a blender for mixing and a cocktail shaker for chilling.</p>"
