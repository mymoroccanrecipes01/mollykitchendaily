    "tips": "When making these cherry martinis, here are some pro tips to keep in mind: \n\n1. **Use fresh cherries**: They make a huge difference in flavor. Look for ones that are firm and bright in color. \n2. **Chill your glasses**: Pop your martini glasses in the freezer for a few minutes before serving. It keeps your drink colder longer. \n3. **Adjust sweetness**: If you prefer a sweeter drink, add a splash of simple syrup. Just mix equal parts sugar and water until dissolved. \n4. **Experiment with flavors**: Try adding a splash of orange liqueur for a different twist. \n5. **Batch it up**: If you’re hosting, make a larger batch in a pitcher. Just multiply the ingredients and stir instead of shaking.",
