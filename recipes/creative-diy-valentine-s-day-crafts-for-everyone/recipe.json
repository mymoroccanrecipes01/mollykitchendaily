Let everyone’s personality shine through their crafts. If you have leftover materials, save them for future projects. They can be great for birthdays or other holidays!",

Stickers, glitter, or even old magazines for cutouts can add flair.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you don’t have construction paper, try using old wrapping paper or even cardboard. It adds a unique touch!<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good pair of scissors is essential. I swear by my OXO Good Grips scissors for easy cutting.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
