                         "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Gradually add this to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.",

    "tips":  "Here are some pro tips to make your cake game strong! First off, always use room temperature ingredients. It makes a huge difference in texture. When it comes to frosting, I like to use a spatula to create swirls and peaks (it looks super fancy!). If you're feeling adventurous, try adding a layer of jam or fruit between the cake layers for a surprise twist. And remember, if your cake domes up while baking, just level it off with a serrated knife before frosting. Trust me, it'll look way better! Lastly, if you want to make it ahead of time, just wrap the cooled cakes in plastic wrap and freeze them. They'll be just as good when you're ready to decorate!",
