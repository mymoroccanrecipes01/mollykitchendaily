    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1 ½ cups granulated sugar",
        "1 cup unsalted butter, softened (I use Kerrygold)",
        "4 large eggs",
        "1 cup whole milk",
        "3 ½ teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Food coloring (various colors for decoration)",
        "Fondant for shaping and detailing",
        "Buttercream frosting (homemade or store-bought)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour your cake pans. I use 9-inch round pans for a classic look.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 5 minutes. Trust me, it makes a difference!",
        "Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then stir in the vanilla extract.",
        "In another bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.",
        "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
        "Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. This step is crucial for a good texture!"
    ],
    "tips": "When it comes to cake decorating, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure your cakes are completely cool before frosting; otherwise, the frosting will melt. I often chill my cakes for about 30 minutes in the fridge to help with this. Also, if you're using fondant, roll it out on a surface dusted with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. For vibrant colors, gel food coloring works best; it won’t alter the cake's texture as much as liquid colors. And don't be afraid to experiment with different shapes and designs! If you mess up, just cover it with more frosting or decorations. Lastly, always have fun with it—baking should be enjoyable!",

I prefer pure vanilla for the best taste. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Butter adds richness and moisture. I use Kerrygold for its creamy texture. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're out of eggs, unsweetened applesauce can work in a pinch.
