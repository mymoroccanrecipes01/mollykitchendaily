    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1 1\/2 cups granulated sugar",
        "1 cup unsalted butter, softened (I use Kerrygold)",
        "4 large eggs",
        "1 cup milk (Organic Valley works great)",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Food coloring (various colors for decoration)",
        "Frosting of your choice (homemade or store-bought)"

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Seriously, don’t skip this step!",
        "In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes.",
        "Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Gradually add this to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.",
        "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
        "Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some pro tips to make your cake game strong! First off, always use room temperature ingredients. It makes a huge difference in texture. When it comes to frosting, I like to use a spatula to create swirls and peaks (it looks super fancy!). If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding a layer of jam or fruit between the cake layers for a surprise twist. And remember, if your cake domes up while baking, just level it off with a serrated knife before frosting. Trust me, it’ll look way better! Lastly, if you want to make it ahead of time, just wrap the cooled cakes in plastic wrap and freeze them. They’ll be just as good when you’re ready to decorate!",
