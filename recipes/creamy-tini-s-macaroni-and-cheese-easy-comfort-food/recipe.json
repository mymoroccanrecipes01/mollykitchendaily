    "ingredients": [
        "8 ounces elbow macaroni",
        "2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese",
        "1 cup milk (whole or 2% works best)",
        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
        "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
        "1\/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1\/2 teaspoon onion powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1\/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional for topping)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the elbow macaroni and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.",
        "In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute until bubbly.",
        "Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.",
        "Add the shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Stir until the cheese melts and the sauce is smooth.",
        "Combine the cooked macaroni with the cheese sauce, mixing well to coat every piece. If you like a crispy topping, transfer to a baking dish, sprinkle breadcrumbs on top, and broil for 2-3 minutes until golden.",
        "Serve hot and enjoy your creamy macaroni and cheese!"

    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your macaroni and cheese even better: \n\n1. Use high-quality cheese like Tillamook for a richer flavor. The better the cheese, the better the dish! \n2. If you want to add some extra flavor, try mixing in cooked bacon or sautéed vegetables. My kids love it with broccoli! \n3. Be careful not to overcook the pasta; it should be al dente since it will continue to cook in the cheese sauce. \n4. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of milk to bring back the creaminess. \n5. My secret? A pinch of cayenne pepper adds a nice kick without being too spicy. Trust me, it’s a game changer!",
