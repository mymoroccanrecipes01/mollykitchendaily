Use high-quality dried fruits for maximum flavor; look for those without added sugars. Avoid overmixing the ingredients to keep the texture light. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of brandy or rum to the mixture before pressing it into the tin.",

If you're looking for substitutions, you can use gluten-free biscuits for a gluten-free version. For a vegan option, substitute butter with coconut oil and ensure the chocolate is dairy-free. Essential tools include a mixing bowl, a baking tin, and a spatula for easy mixing and pressing.<\/p>"
