    "tips": "Here's the thing: To achieve the perfect chaos cake, consider these professional tips: - Use room temperature ingredients for better mixing and texture. - When coloring your batter, start with a small amount of food coloring and gradually add more until you reach the desired shade. - Avoid overmixing the batter to keep the cake light and fluffy. - Store leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. - For an impressive finish, use a spatula to create swirls and peaks in the frosting, and generously sprinkle with colorful decorations.",

Your call.</li><li><strong>Butter and eggs:</strong> Need them at room temperature. Cold butter won't mix right. Leave them out for like an hour before you start. Makes a difference.</li><li><strong>Food coloring:</strong> This is the fun part. Get a bunch of different colors. Gel food coloring works best because it's more concentrated. Don't need as much.</li><li><strong>Buttercream frosting:</strong> Can make your own or buy it. Nobody will judge you for using store bought. I usually buy it because who has time to make frosting from scratch.</li><li><strong>Sprinkles and decorations:</strong> Go crazy. Buy all the fun stuff. Different colors, different shapes. More is more with chaos cakes.</li></ul>"
