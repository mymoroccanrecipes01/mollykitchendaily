If you want a spicier kick, add more cayenne pepper or even some chopped jalapeños. For a creamier texture, consider adding a bit of mayonnaise. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat gently in the microwave if desired, but it's best enjoyed cold.",
