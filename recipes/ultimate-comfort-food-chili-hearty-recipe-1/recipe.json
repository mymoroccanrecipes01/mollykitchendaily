        "2 cans (15 oz each) kidney beans, drained and rinsed",

    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and bell pepper, sautéing until softened, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Add ground beef to the pot, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain excess fat if necessary.",
        "Stir in chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes to toast the spices.",
        "Add crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, and beef broth. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cover. Let it cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally.",

    "tips": "Here's the thing: For perfect chili, use a mix of beans for varied texture and flavor. Always taste and adjust seasoning before serving. If you like it spicy, add diced jalapeños or a dash of hot sauce. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much. For a richer flavor, let the chili sit overnight in the fridge before serving.",

Brown it good for best taste.</li><li><strong>Beans:</strong> Kidney beans are classic but any beans work. Pinto beans, black beans, whatever. I use two cans because beans stretch the meat and make it cheaper.</li><li><strong>Crushed tomatoes:</strong> Big can of crushed tomatoes gives it body. Don't use diced tomatoes. They don't break down the same. Crushed is what you want.</li><li><strong>Chili powder:</strong> Main spice. Don't be shy with it. Two tablespoons is right. Less and it tastes bland. More if you like it spicier.</li><li><strong>Beef broth:</strong> Makes it more soup like instead of too thick. Can use water if you don't have broth but broth tastes better.</li><li><strong>Big pot:</strong> Need something that holds everything. Dutch oven is perfect but any big pot works.</li></ul>"

Whatever's easier.</p><p>Heat oil in your pot. Cook the onion and pepper until they're soft. Takes like 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute. Then add the ground beef. Break it up with your spoon while it cooks. You want it all browned. Drain the fat if there's a lot. I usually don't bother if I used lean beef.</p><p>Throw in your spices and stir them around for a couple minutes. This toasts them and makes them taste better. Then add the tomatoes, beans, and broth. Stir it all up. Bring it to a bubble then turn the heat down low. Put a lid on it and let it simmer for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir it every once in a while so nothing sticks to the bottom.</p><p>Taste it before serving. Add more salt, pepper, or chili powder if it needs it.
