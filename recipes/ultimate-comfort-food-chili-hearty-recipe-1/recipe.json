Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much.

Freshness is key; check the color and smell. For seasonings, chili powder is essential for that classic flavor, while cumin and smoked paprika add depth. If you're looking for alternatives, ground turkey or chicken can be used for a lighter version. For a vegetarian option, substitute with lentils or black beans. Essential tools include a large pot for even cooking and a wooden spoon for stirring.<\/p>"
