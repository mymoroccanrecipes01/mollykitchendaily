Plus you can eat it with your hands which is always a bonus.</p><p>I started making these when I got tired of boring sandwiches. Wanted something with more flavor that still worked for lunch. These hit the spot. My kids actually eat them without complaining. That alone makes them worth making.</p>"

Making your own is better if you have time but bottled tastes good enough for wraps.</li><li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Lettuce, carrots, bell peppers, cucumbers. Whatever crunchy vegetables you like. Adds texture and makes it healthier or whatever.</li><li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> Flour tortillas work best. Big ones so you can fit everything. Whole wheat if you want to feel better about it.</li><li><strong>Skillet:</strong> For cooking the chicken. Any pan that fits on your stove works.</li></ul>"

Add the cooked chicken. Pile on your vegetables. Drizzle more teriyaki sauce if you want. Roll it up tight. Fold in the sides first then roll. Cut it in half diagonally because that looks better.</dd></dl>"
