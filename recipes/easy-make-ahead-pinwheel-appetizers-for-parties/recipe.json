    "ingredients": [
        "4 large flour tortillas",
        "8 oz cream cheese, softened (I use Philadelphia)",
        "1 cup fresh spinach, chopped",
        "1 bell pepper, diced (red or yellow for color)",
        "1 carrot, grated",
        "1/2 cup cucumber, finely chopped",
        "1/4 cup ranch dressing (or your favorite dip)",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by spreading a generous layer of cream cheese on each tortilla, making sure to cover the entire surface.",
        "Sprinkle the chopped spinach evenly over the cream cheese, followed by the diced bell pepper, grated carrot, and cucumber.",
        "Drizzle a little ranch dressing over the veggies, then season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Roll each tortilla tightly from one end to the other, making sure the filling stays inside.",
        "Wrap the rolled tortillas in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up.",
        "Once chilled, slice the pinwheels into bite-sized pieces and arrange them on a platter."
    ],
    "tips": "Okay so real talk - use tortillas that are actually fresh, not the ones that've been sitting in your pantry for weeks. If they're kinda stiff, just pop them in the microwave for like 10 seconds. And honestly? Throw in whatever veggies you've got. I've used olives, different cheeses, even leftover roasted peppers. Want some heat? Jalapeños are your friend, or just mix some chili powder into the cream cheese. Make these the night before if you're hosting - less stress, more wine. Oh and if you need them gluten-free, corn tortillas work great, just saying.",

The spinach or wheat ones are good if you're feeling health-conscious or whatever.</p><ul><li><strong>The creamy stuff:</strong> Cream cheese is non-negotiable here. Philadelphia's my go-to because it spreads easy and doesn't get weird. Room temperature is key - cold cream cheese is a nightmare to work with. Throw some dill or chives in there if you want to get fancy.</li><li><strong>Veggies:</strong> Bell peppers and cucumbers give you that satisfying crunch. I grate the carrot instead of chopping it because otherwise you get these annoying carrot chunks that fall out when you bite. Trust the process.</li><li><strong>Mix it up:</strong> Hummus instead of cream cheese works if you want lighter. Add turkey or ham if you need actual protein. Sometimes I throw in whatever leftover roasted veggies I have - it all works.</li><li><strong>Tools:</strong> Sharp knife. That's it. Don't try this with a dull knife unless you like mangled pinwheels.</li></ul>"
