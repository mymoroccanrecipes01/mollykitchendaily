    "ingredients": [
        "4 large flour tortillas",
        "8 oz cream cheese, softened (I use Philadelphia)",
        "1 cup fresh spinach, chopped",
        "1 bell pepper, diced (red or yellow for color)",
        "1 carrot, grated",
        "1\/2 cup cucumber, finely chopped",
        "1\/4 cup ranch dressing (or your favorite dip)",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by spreading a generous layer of cream cheese on each tortilla, making sure to cover the entire surface.",
        "Sprinkle the chopped spinach evenly over the cream cheese, followed by the diced bell pepper, grated carrot, and cucumber.",
        "Drizzle a little ranch dressing over the veggies, then season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Roll each tortilla tightly from one end to the other, making sure the filling stays inside.",
        "Wrap the rolled tortillas in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up.",
        "Once chilled, slice the pinwheels into bite-sized pieces and arrange them on a platter."
    ],
    "tips": "When making these pinwheels, here are some tips to keep in mind: \n\n- Use fresh tortillas for the best texture. If they’re too stiff, warm them slightly in the microwave for a few seconds. \n- Feel free to mix and match veggies based on what you have on hand. I often add sliced olives or shredded cheese. \n- For a little kick, try adding some sliced jalapeños or a sprinkle of chili powder to the cream cheese. \n- These pinwheels can be made a day in advance. Just keep them tightly wrapped in the fridge to maintain freshness. \n- If you want to make them gluten-free, use corn tortillas instead. They hold up well and taste great too!",

You can also use spinach or whole wheat tortillas for added flavor and nutrition.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Cream cheese is the star here, providing a rich base. I like to use Philadelphia for its smooth texture. You can also mix in some herbs like dill or chives for an extra flavor boost.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Fresh veggies add crunch and color. I always use a mix of bell peppers and cucumbers for a refreshing bite.
