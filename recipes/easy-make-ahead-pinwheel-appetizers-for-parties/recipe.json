    "tips": "To achieve the best results with your pinwheel appetizers, consider these professional tips: \n- Use fresh ingredients: Fresh vegetables not only enhance flavor but also add vibrant color to your pinwheels. Look for crisp, bright veggies. \n- Avoid sogginess: Make sure to drain any excess moisture from the vegetables before adding them to the cream cheese to prevent soggy tortillas. \n- Chill properly: Allow the rolled tortillas to chill for at least 30 minutes; this helps them hold their shape when slicing. \n- Presentation matters: For an impressive display, arrange the pinwheels in a circular pattern on a platter and garnish with fresh herbs. \n- Make-ahead convenience: These pinwheels can be made a day in advance, making them a stress-free option for party planning.",
