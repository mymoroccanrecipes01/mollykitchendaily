Avoid overcooking the mushrooms initially, as they should retain some texture. For storage, keep the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove to maintain creaminess. If you want a thicker soup, blend more of the mixture. For a lighter version, substitute heavy cream with coconut milk or a non-dairy alternative.",
