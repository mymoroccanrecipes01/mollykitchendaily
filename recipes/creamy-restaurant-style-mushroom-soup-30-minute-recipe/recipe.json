    "tips": "To achieve the best flavor, use a variety of mushrooms such as cremini, shiitake, and button mushrooms. This blend adds depth to the soup. Avoid overcooking the mushrooms initially, as they should retain some texture. For storage, keep the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove to maintain creaminess. If you want a thicker soup, blend more of the mixture. For a lighter version, substitute heavy cream with coconut milk or a non-dairy alternative.",
