    "tips": "To ensure perfect cheeseburger bombs, use high-quality ground beef and season it well for maximum flavor. Avoid overfilling the biscuits to prevent them from bursting during baking. For a crispy exterior, brush the tops with melted butter before baking. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, and reheat in the oven to maintain crispiness. If you're short on time, you can use pre-cooked beef or leftover burgers for a quicker option.",

If you're feeling adventurous, you can make your own from scratch for a more personalized touch.<\/li><li><strong>Shredded cheddar cheese:<\/strong> Opt for sharp cheddar for a more robust flavor. You can also experiment with other cheeses like mozzarella or pepper jack for a spicy kick.<\/li><li><strong>Garlic powder:<\/strong> This adds a wonderful aroma and flavor. Fresh minced garlic can be used as a substitute, but adjust the quantity to taste.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> For a gluten-free version, use gluten-free biscuit dough.
