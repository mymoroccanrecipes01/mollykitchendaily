For added flavor, consider using flavored extracts like almond or peppermint. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If they become too hard, you can microwave them for a few seconds to soften. For a fun twist, try adding chocolate chips or nuts to the mixture before pressing it into the pan.",
