    "ingredients": [
        "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing",
        "1 package (10 oz) mini marshmallows",
        "6 cups crispy rice cereal",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Sprinkles for decoration (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by greasing a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter. This helps the treats come out easily later.",
        "In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, add the marshmallows and stir until completely melted and smooth.",
        "Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Then, quickly add the crispy rice cereal and mix until well combined.",
        "Press the mixture into the prepared baking dish using a buttered spatula or your hands (lightly greased to prevent sticking). Make sure it's packed tightly.",
        "Let the treats cool for about 30 minutes before cutting into squares. If you want, sprinkle some festive decorations on top before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some pro tips to make your Rice Krispie Treats even better! First, use fresh marshmallows for the best texture. If you want a richer flavor, try adding a pinch of salt to the melted marshmallow mixture. For a fun twist, mix in some chocolate chips or peanut butter for extra flavor. When pressing the mixture into the pan, dampen your hands slightly to avoid sticking. And if you have leftovers (which is rare!), store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to a month, just make sure to wrap them well!",
