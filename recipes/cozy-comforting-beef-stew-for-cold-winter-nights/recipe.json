    "tips": "For the best beef stew, choose well-marbled beef chuck for tenderness. Browning the meat adds depth of flavor, so don’t skip this step. Avoid overcooking the vegetables; add them halfway through the cooking time for perfect texture. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave. For a thicker stew, mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with cold water and stir it in during the last 15 minutes of cooking.",

For dietary needs, consider <strong>substituting beef with mushrooms<\/strong> for a vegetarian option, and use vegetable broth instead of beef broth.
