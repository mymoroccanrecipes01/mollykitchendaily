    "ingredients": [
        "1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1 ½ cups granulated sugar",
        "¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Ghirardelli)",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking soda",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1 cup whole milk",
        "½ cup vegetable oil",
        "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
        "1 cup boiling water",
        "1 cup chocolate frosting (store-bought or homemade)",
        "Decorative candies for eyes and ears"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. This helps the cakes release easily later.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk them together until well mixed.",
        "Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth. Then, carefully stir in the boiling water (the batter will be thin).",
        "Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks.",
        "Once cooled, level the tops of the cakes if needed. Spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake, then place the second cake on top. Frost the entire cake and get creative with the decorations!",
        "Use candies to create the rat's features, like eyes and ears. Have fun with it!"
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your rat cake a success! First, make sure your ingredients are at room temperature for better mixing. If your cake layers dome up while baking, just slice off the tops to make them flat. For a richer flavor, you can substitute half of the boiling water with brewed coffee (trust me, it enhances the chocolate!). When frosting, use a spatula to create texture for a fur-like appearance. And if you're short on time, store-bought frosting works just fine! You can also prepare the cake layers a day in advance and store them wrapped in plastic wrap to keep them fresh. Lastly, don't stress about the decorations; the more playful, the better!",

I always use pure vanilla for a more aromatic cake. It really makes a difference in the overall taste.<\/p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The eggs and milk add moisture and richness. I prefer whole milk for a creamier texture, but you can use any milk you have on hand.<\/p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're out of eggs, try using unsweetened applesauce (1\/4 cup per egg). For a dairy-free option, almond milk works well too!<\/p><p><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good quality mixer, like my KitchenAid, makes mixing the batter a breeze.
