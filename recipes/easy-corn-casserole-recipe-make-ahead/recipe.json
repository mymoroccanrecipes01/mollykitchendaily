    "tips": "To achieve the best results with this corn casserole, consider these professional tips: \n- Ensure the whole kernel corn is well-drained to prevent excess moisture, which can make the casserole soggy. \n- Use room temperature ingredients for a smoother mix; this helps the casserole bake evenly. \n- Avoid overbaking; check for doneness when the top is golden brown and the center is firm. \n- For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 300°F (150°C) for 10-15 minutes to maintain texture. \n- If you want to add a flavor boost, consider mixing in some diced jalapeños or bell peppers for a bit of heat and color.",
