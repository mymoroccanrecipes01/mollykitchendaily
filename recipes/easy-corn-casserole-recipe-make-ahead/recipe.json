    "ingredients": [
        "1 box Jiffy corn muffin mix",
        "1 can (15 oz) creamed corn",
        "1 can (15 oz) whole kernel corn, drained",
        "1 cup sour cream",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese",

        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 teaspoon black pepper"

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the Jiffy mix, creamed corn, whole kernel corn, sour cream, melted butter, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.",
        "Fold in half of the shredded cheddar cheese, saving the rest for topping.",
        "Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.",
        "Sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese on top.",
        "Bake for 45 minutes or until the casserole is golden and set in the center. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "When making this casserole, I always recommend using fresh ingredients for the best flavor. If you want a bit of a kick, try adding some diced jalapeños or green chilies. You can also swap out the cheddar for pepper jack cheese for a spicier version. For a creamier texture, consider adding an extra dollop of sour cream. And if you have leftovers, they reheat beautifully in the oven or microwave. Just make sure to cover it to keep it moist!",
