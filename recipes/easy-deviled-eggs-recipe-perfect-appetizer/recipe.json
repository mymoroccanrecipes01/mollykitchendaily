When boiling, ensure the water is at a rolling boil before covering and removing from heat. For maximum flavor, adjust the amount of mustard and vinegar to your taste. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. If making ahead, prepare the filling and store separately from the egg whites to maintain freshness.",
