I had an orange sitting on the counter and thought why not. Turns out, chocolate and orange actually get along pretty well.</p><p>The first sip surprised me. It still tastes like hot chocolate first. Creamy and warm. Then you get a light orange flavor at the end. Not strong. Just enough to notice. Now I make this Zesty Orange Hot Chocolate for Cozy Nights anytime we want something quick and cozy after dinner.</p><p>This is a fast and easy recipe. Nothing fancy. Just milk, cocoa powder, a bit of cream, and fresh orange zest. Perfect for a weeknight treat or when the family wants something warm before bed.</p>"
