The chicken gets super tender and soaks up all that sweet pineapple sauce. My kids actually eat this without complaining which is basically a miracle.</p><p>First time I made this I was skeptical about the pineapple and soy sauce combo. Sounded weird to me. But it works really well together. Sweet and salty in a good way. Now I make it probably twice a month because it's so easy and everyone likes it.</p>"

Fresh pineapple works but who has time to cut up a whole pineapple on a weekday.</li><li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong> Regular soy sauce from the store. Low sodium if you want less salt. Tamari if you need gluten free.</li><li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> Adds sweetness to balance the salty soy sauce. Light or dark brown sugar both work fine.</li><li><strong>Garlic and ginger:</strong> Pre-minced from a jar is totally acceptable. Fresh is better but jarred saves time. Use what you've got.</li><li><strong>Crockpot:</strong> Any slow cooker works. Doesn't need to be fancy.</li></ul>"

Sprinkle the brown sugar on top. Add the garlic and ginger. Give it a quick stir if you want but honestly you don't even have to. Put the lid on and turn it to low.</dd><dt><strong>Cooking it:</strong></dt><dd>Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours. If your chicken was frozen, go for 6 hours. If it was thawed, 4 hours is probably enough. You'll know it's done when the chicken shreds easily with a fork.</dd><dt><strong>Finishing up:</strong></dt><dd>Take two forks and shred the chicken right in the crockpot. Mix it all around with the sauce. That's it. Serve it over rice or whatever.</dd></dl>"
