Just read the package for cooking time.</li><li><strong>Spinach:</strong> Fresh is better but honestly frozen works too. Just squeeze out the extra water first. Adds some green vegetables so you don't feel guilty.</li><li><strong>Chicken broth:</strong> Store bought is totally fine. I keep boxes in the pantry all the time. Makes everything taste better than water.</li><li><strong>A big pot:</strong> Needs to fit everything without overflowing. I use my dutch oven but any big soup pot works.</li></ul>"
