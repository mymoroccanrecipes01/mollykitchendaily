    "tips": "To achieve the best results, use fresh, ripe cherries for maximum flavor. If using frozen cherries, thaw and drain excess liquid to avoid a watery filling. Always pre-bake the crust for a few minutes if using a store-bought crust to prevent sogginess. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of bourbon or brandy to the cherry mixture. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, and reheat in the oven for best texture.",

            "content": "<p>When it comes to cherry desserts, the main ingredient is, of course, the cherries. Look for fresh, ripe cherries that are firm and juicy, as they will provide the best flavor and texture. For key seasonings, granulated sugar is essential for balancing the tartness of the cherries, while vanilla and almond extracts add depth to the flavor profile. If you're looking for smart substitutions, consider using frozen cherries if fresh ones are unavailable, just be sure to thaw and drain them well. For those with dietary restrictions, a gluten-free flour blend can easily replace all-purpose flour, and a dairy-free butter substitute can be used for a vegan version. Essential tools include a mixing bowl, measuring cups, and a pie dish for baking.</p>"
