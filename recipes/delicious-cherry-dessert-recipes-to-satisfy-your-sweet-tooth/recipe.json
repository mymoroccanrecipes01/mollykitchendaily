    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups fresh cherries, pitted and halved",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
        "1 pre-made pie crust or tart shell",
        "1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces",
        "1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)",
        "Powdered sugar for dusting"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).",
        "In a medium bowl, combine the pitted cherries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and cornstarch. Stir until the cherries are well coated.",
        "Roll out the pie crust and fit it into a pie dish. Pour the cherry mixture into the crust and dot with butter pieces.",
        "Cover with a second layer of crust, sealing the edges. Cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg.",
        "Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.",
        "Let it cool slightly before serving. Dust with powdered sugar before slicing."
    ],
    "tips": "When making cherry desserts, always choose fresh, ripe cherries for the best flavor. I usually go for Bing cherries, but Rainier cherries work well too. If you're short on time, using a pre-made crust saves a lot of hassle. And remember, if your filling seems too runny, a little extra cornstarch can help thicken it up. For a twist, try adding almond extract instead of vanilla for a nutty flavor. Lastly, serve your cherry dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delightful contrast!",
