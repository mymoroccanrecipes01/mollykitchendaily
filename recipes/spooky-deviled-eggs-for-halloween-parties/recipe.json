    "tips": "Here's the thing: To achieve perfectly hard-boiled eggs, place them in a pot of cold water, bring to a boil, then cover and remove from heat for 12 minutes. After cooking, immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process and make peeling easier. For maximum flavor, use high-quality mayonnaise and adjust seasoning to your taste. These deviled eggs can be made a day ahead; just keep them covered in the fridge. When serving, consider using a decorative platter to enhance the Halloween theme.",

Kids think it's hilarious.</p><p>I make these every Halloween now. They're way easier than most party food and people always eat them all. Last year I made a double batch and they were gone in like 15 minutes. This year I'm making triple. You can never have too many deviled eggs at a party.</p>"

This is what makes the filling creamy.</li><li><strong>Dijon mustard:</strong> Gives it that tangy flavor. Regular yellow mustard works too if that's what you have. Just use less because it's stronger.</li><li><strong>Black olives:</strong> These become the spider bodies. Get the sliced ones to save time.

Scoop out all the yolks into a bowl. Mash them up with a fork until they're crumbly. Add mayo, mustard, salt, and pepper. Mix it until it's smooth and creamy. If you want green filling, add a few drops of food coloring now. Not too much or it looks radioactive.</p><p>Put the filling back in the egg whites. You can use a spoon but a piping bag looks way better. Just dump the filling in a plastic bag and cut the corner off if you don't have a fancy piping bag. Works the same. Put an olive slice on each egg to look like a spider body. Add little pieces of olive for legs if you're feeling creative. Stick some diced red pepper on top for color. Done.</p>"
