    "tips": "When making vegan meals, always taste as you go. It helps you adjust flavors to your liking. I use organic quinoa for better quality and flavor. If you want to add some heat, consider tossing in jalapeños or a dash of hot sauce. Also, don't skip the lime juice; it brightens up the dish! Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days, and they taste even better the next day. Just give it a good stir before serving.",

Rinse it well before cooking to avoid bitterness. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor that complements the beans perfectly. I like to use McCormick cumin for its robust taste. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Fresh veggies like bell peppers and avocados not only add color but also provide essential nutrients. Dice them just before serving for the best texture. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you don’t have quinoa, try brown rice or farro. They’ll give a different texture but still work well. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good pot for cooking quinoa is essential. I recommend using a non-stick pot for easy cleanup.<\/p>"

Cook until fluffy, about 15 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when the grains look like little spirals. Finishing touches: Once everything is mixed, serve it in bowls and top with avocado and cilantro.
