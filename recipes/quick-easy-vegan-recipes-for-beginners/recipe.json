    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups mixed fresh vegetables (like bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots), chopped",
        "1 cup cooked quinoa or brown rice",
        "1 can black beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh herbs for garnish (like cilantro or parsley)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss in garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
        "Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until they’re tender but still vibrant.",
        "Stir in the cooked quinoa or brown rice, black beans, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well and cook for another 5 minutes until everything is heated through.",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If you want a kick, add some chili flakes!",

    "tips": "When it comes to quick vegan meals, prep is key! Chop your veggies ahead of time and store them in the fridge. I love using a mix of seasonal veggies for freshness. If you’re short on time, frozen veggies work great too! My secret? Always keep canned beans on hand for a protein boost. And don't forget to taste as you go - it makes a world of difference! For leftovers, store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat on the stove for best results, adding a splash of water to keep it moist.",

I love using whatever's in season, but frozen veggies can save time too. Just toss them in frozen!<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you don’t have quinoa, try bulgur or couscous.
