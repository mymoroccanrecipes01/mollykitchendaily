Look for brands that are smooth and not overly grainy.\n- Ensure your espresso is cooled before dipping the ladyfingers; this prevents them from becoming too soggy.\n- Avoid over-whipping the heavy cream to maintain a light and airy texture in the final dessert.\n- For storage, keep the tiramisu covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can also be frozen for up to a month, but the texture may change slightly upon thawing.\n- Serve chilled for the best flavor experience, and consider adding a sprinkle of nutmeg for an extra flavor boost.",
