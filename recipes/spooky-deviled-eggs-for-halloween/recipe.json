    "tips": "To achieve perfectly hard-boiled eggs, place them in a pot of cold water, bring to a boil, then cover and remove from heat for 12 minutes. Cool immediately in ice water to prevent a green ring around the yolk. When selecting eggs, fresher eggs are harder to peel, so use eggs that are at least a week old for easier peeling. For a creamier filling, use a high-quality mayonnaise. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. To reheat leftover eggs, place them in a microwave-safe dish and heat for 10-15 seconds, but be cautious as they can become rubbery if overheated.",

            "content": "<p>When making deviled eggs, the main ingredient is, of course, the eggs. Look for large, fresh eggs for the best results. Fresh eggs can be harder to peel, so using eggs that are about a week old is ideal. The key seasonings include mayonnaise and Dijon mustard, which create a creamy and tangy filling. For a unique twist, you can use flavored mayonnaise or add a dash of hot sauce for heat. Supporting ingredients like black olives not only add flavor but also enhance the spooky presentation. If you're looking for substitutions, consider using avocado instead of mayonnaise for a healthier, dairy-free option. Essential tools include a pot for boiling the eggs and a mixing bowl for combining the filling.<\/p>"
