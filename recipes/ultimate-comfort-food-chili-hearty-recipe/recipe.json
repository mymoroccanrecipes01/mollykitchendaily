    "tips":  "Here's the thing: To achieve the best flavor, use high-quality ground beef and allow the chili to simmer for longer if time permits. This enhances the depth of flavor. Avoid overcooking the garlic to prevent bitterness. For maximum flavor, consider using homemade beef broth. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of water if needed to maintain consistency.",

Takes maybe an hour total and most of that is just letting it bubble on the stove.</p><p>What I like about it is you can make a big pot and eat it all week. Or freeze half for later when you don't feel like cooking. We usually have it with cornbread but honestly it's fine by itself too.</p>"

You could do all one kind if that's what you have. Nobody's going to know the difference really. Just drain them good and rinse them or the chili gets too thick and weird.</p><p>The spices are chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika. The smoked paprika is optional but it adds something nice.
