    "tips": "To achieve the best flavor, use high-quality ground beef and allow the chili to simmer for longer if time permits. This enhances the depth of flavor. Avoid overcooking the garlic to prevent bitterness. For maximum flavor, consider using homemade beef broth. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of water if needed to maintain consistency.",
