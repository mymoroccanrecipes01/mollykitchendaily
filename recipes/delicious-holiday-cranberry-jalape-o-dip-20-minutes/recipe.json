        "1 cup fresh cranberries, rinsed",

    "instructions": [
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the cranberries and chopped jalapeños. Use a fork to mash them slightly, releasing some juices.",
        "Add the softened cream cheese and sour cream to the bowl. Mix until well combined and creamy.",
        "Stir in the lime juice and honey, adjusting sweetness to your liking. Season with salt to taste.",
        "Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.",
        "Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy the tangy, spicy goodness!"
    ],
    "tips": "When making this dip, consider using fresh cranberries for the best flavor. If you can’t find them, frozen cranberries work too, just thaw them first. For a milder dip, use only one jalapeño or remove all the seeds. If you want a creamier texture, add more cream cheese or sour cream. I like to let it chill for at least 30 minutes; it really helps the flavors come together. And trust me, this dip gets even better the next day, so don’t hesitate to make it ahead of time!",

When shopping, look for bright, firm berries. If you can’t find fresh, frozen works too, just thaw them first.<\/p><p><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> The jalapeños add a spicy kick. I usually remove the seeds for less heat, but if you like it fiery, leave them in. Lime juice brightens the flavors and adds a refreshing zing.<\/p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Cream cheese and sour cream give the dip its creamy texture. I prefer using Organic Valley sour cream for its richness. Honey or maple syrup adds a touch of sweetness to balance the tartness.<\/p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap cream cheese for Greek yogurt for a lighter version. If you want a vegan option, use cashew cream instead. Both will change the texture slightly but still taste great!<\/p><p><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A sturdy mixing bowl is essential for combining everything. I use my KitchenAid mixer for a super smooth texture.<\/p>"
