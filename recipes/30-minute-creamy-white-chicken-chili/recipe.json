Just drain them and rinse them off.</li><li><strong>Heavy cream:</strong> This is what makes it creamy and good. Half and half works too if that's what you have. Makes the whole thing rich.</li><li><strong>Spices:</strong> Cumin and chili powder are the main ones. Don't skip the cumin, it's what gives it that chili flavor.</li><li><strong>A big pot:</strong> Needs to fit everything. I use my dutch oven but any big pot works fine.</li></ul>"
