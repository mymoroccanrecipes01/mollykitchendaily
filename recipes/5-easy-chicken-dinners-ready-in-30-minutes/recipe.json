Not boring but not too spicy either. I always have both in my cabinet because I use them a lot.</li><li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Any olive oil works. The cheap kind is fine for cooking. Save the expensive bottle for salad or whatever.</li><li><strong>Big pan:</strong> You need a big pan. If the chicken is all squished together it won't get brown and crispy. A 12 inch pan is what I use.</li></ul>"
