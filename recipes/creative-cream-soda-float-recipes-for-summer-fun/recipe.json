    "description": "These cream soda floats are my go-to when it's scorching outside. Just fizzy cream soda and ice cream - that's it! They're always a hit at cookouts, and honestly, I make them way too often just because. Save this for your next hot day.",

    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups cream soda (I use A&W but whatever you've got works)",
        "4 scoops vanilla ice cream (or honestly any flavor - your call)",
        "Whipped cream if you want to get fancy",

    "instructions": [
        "Pour about a cup of cream soda into each glass. Watch it fizz - that's the good stuff.",
        "Drop in a big scoop of ice cream. Don't be stingy here.",
        "Add some whipped cream on top if you want. Makes it look prettier.",
        "Stick a cherry on top. Yeah, it's cheesy, but it's also classic.",
        "Throw on some sprinkles if you've got kids around (or if you just want to).",
        "Hand it over with a straw and spoon before the ice cream melts everywhere."
    ],
    "tips": "Few things I've learned making these way too many times:\n\n- Cold glasses keep everything from melting into a mess too fast. Just stick them in the freezer for a bit.\n- Mix up the ice cream flavors - chocolate's pretty solid, and mint's actually really good if you're into that.\n- Go wild with toppings. There's no float police.\n- If somehow you don't finish them all (never happens at my house), keep the soda and ice cream separate or it gets weird.\n- Toss in some flavored syrup if you want to experiment. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.",
