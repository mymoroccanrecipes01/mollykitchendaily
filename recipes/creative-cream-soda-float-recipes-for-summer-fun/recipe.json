    "tips": "When making cream soda floats, here are some tips to keep in mind: \n1. Use chilled cream soda to prevent the ice cream from melting too quickly. It keeps the float refreshing and bubbly. \n2. Experiment with different ice cream flavors to find your favorite combo. I love mixing vanilla with a splash of root beer soda! \n3. If you want a thicker float, use less soda and more ice cream. It’s all about your preference! \n4. For a fun twist, try adding flavored syrups or fruit purees to the soda before adding ice cream. It adds a unique flavor dimension. \n5. Make it a party! Set up a float bar with various sodas and ice cream flavors for guests to create their own combinations. It’s a hit every time!",

It really enhances the float experience. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> You can add a splash of vanilla extract for an extra flavor kick. It complements the ice cream beautifully. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Whipped cream adds a nice creamy texture on top. I usually go for the canned version for convenience. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you want a lighter option, try using sparkling water with a splash of vanilla syrup instead of cream soda. It’s refreshing and still delicious!<\/p>"
