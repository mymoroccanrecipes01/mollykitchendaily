For added flavor, consider using flavored syrups or different ice cream varieties. Avoid pouring the soda too quickly to prevent excessive fizzing. If making ahead, prepare the components separately and assemble just before serving to maintain texture. Store any leftover floats in the freezer, but consume within a day for best quality.",
