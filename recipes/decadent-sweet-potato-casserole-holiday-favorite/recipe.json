For maximum flavor, use fresh spices instead of pre-ground. Avoid over-mixing the sweet potato mixture to keep it light and fluffy. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, and reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of maple syrup to the sweet potato mixture.",
